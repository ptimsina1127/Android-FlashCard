Implement either the Expense Tracking App OR the Flash Card App that uses at least two activities (screens) and intents to pass data between them.

You only need to implement one of these UI designs. At this point you have had plenty of practice with these concepts so have fun and try to be creative. You only need to implement the screens as Activities and the Intents to traverse from one screen to another. See if you can get the actual functionality to work. Your app does not need to store and use data. You will be adding this component in a future assignment.
